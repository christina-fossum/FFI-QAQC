Rocky Mountain National Park Fire Effects
Automated process for conducting QA/QC of FFI data in R

Edited: Christina Fossum 3/31/2025


Purpose: 
The goal of this process is to provide a systematic approach to ensure accuracy and consistency in our program's fire effects data, as well as to provide a single accessible location to document and track progress.

Workflow:
1. Clone 'FFI-QAQC' github repository onto desktop
2. Download FFI data into 'FFI Data - WORKING' folder within desktop repository
3. Track changes to code by frequently committing to GitHub repository
4. Log progress on Error Logs 

Contents:
- 'FFI-QAQC' R project
- Individual R scripts for conducting QAQC error analyses 
    1. 2024 Rapid Assessment Plots
    2. 2024 Allenspark Plots
    3. FMH PIPO Plots
- 'FFI data - WORKING' folder (this is where you download data from FFI - just store these files locally, do NOT need to commit to GitHub)
- 'Error Logs' folder: Excel files for logging error checking progress
- '2024PlotFFIKey' excel file: Outline of error log queries contained in R scripts
